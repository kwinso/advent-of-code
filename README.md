# Advent of Code

Here's me solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) (at least for 2024).

## Seeing my solutions

I'm using [Livebook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook). The most convinient way to use livebook without the hustle is to use docker:
[instructions on running livebook with docker](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook?tab=readme-ov-file#docker). Run the second option while being in the root of this repository.

Then head to the Livebook homepage and click `Open` at the top right and select the notebook you want to open.

Have fun!
